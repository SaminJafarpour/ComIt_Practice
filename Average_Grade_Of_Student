'''Make a program in Python such that given as data the enrolment and 5 grades of a student;
Print the enrolment, the average and the word "approved" if the student has an average greater
than or equal to 6, and the word "not approved" otherwise. Data: MAT, CAL1, CAL2, CAL3, CAL4,
CAL5 Where: MAT is an integer variable that represents the student's enrolment. CAL1, CAL2,
CAL3, CAL4 and CAL5 are real-type variables representing the student's 5 grades.'''

    if average >=6:
